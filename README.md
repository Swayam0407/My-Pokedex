# Pokémon Finder

A dynamic web application designed to display Pokémon cards based on the input for the number of cards and type of Pokémon.This project uses the PokeAPI to fetch real-time data and presents it in a visually appealing, fully responsive design.

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Pokémon Search:** Users can select the number of Pokémon cards to display based on their type (e.g., Fire, Water, Electric, etc.).
- **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Pokémon data is fetched from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) using asynchronous promises, ensuring smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Save Your Favorites:** Users can save their favorite Pokémon cards to a personal collection by clicking the "Save" button.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across all devices, from desktops to mobile.
- **CORS Handling:** Implemented CORS to ensure proper interaction between the front-end and back-end, even when deployed on different domains.

## 🚀 Motivation

I developed this project to gain hands-on experience with API integrations and promises. As a Pokémon fan, I wanted to combine my love for childhood nostalgia with web development. Along the way, I explored various concepts like CORS, error handling, and asynchronous JavaScript. I also designed the front-end to be interactive and user-friendly, taking inspiration from classic gaming styles.

## 📖 How It Works

1. Users can specify the number of Pokémon they want to view and the type of Pokémon (e.g., Fire, Water, Electric, etc.).
2. The app fetches the Pokémon data from the PokeAPI and displays the cards.
3. Users can save their favorite Pokémon cards, which are stored in a separate section labeled "My Cards."

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (including Google Fonts), Vanilla JavaScript
- **API:** PokeAPI
- **CORS:** Handled to enable communication between different domains
